Intro:
This was the game the three of us submitted for the ImagineCup 2011 Fall competition
in our Intro to Game Development course at the University of Houston.

Compiling:
This project was created using Visual Studio 2010 with XNA Game Studio 4.0.
Open the .sln file to load the project and hit F5 to compile.

Running:
The game is a top-down "bullet-hell" style shooter that was made in three months by three students
with more experience in C++ than C#, and is unfinished in many places. Some parts of the code were
almost literally added at the last minute.

In gameplay, use the arrow keys to move the ship around, S to fire your current weapon, and 
A/D to quickly dodge left/right. After killing enough enemies, you can press W to power up your weapon.
You can change these controls in the Controller.cs file.

As you play through the level, you will eventually encounter new enemies and two "mini-bosses".
If the player survives, the game will eventually lock your controls and take you to the final 
boss of the level before ending the game.

The project and assets are provided as-is, with no warranty.
